Take your pic. Share your story. 
This is a very barebones full-stack project I built at Hack Reactor. It utilizes a MongoDB database which is served by a Node/expressJS server. AngularJS framework completes the front end. Upload pics, assign a category, and look around based on your interests. To deploy, clone down the repo, install dependencies by npm install (may need to sudo npm install), run 'node server.js', and go to localhost:8000.

Below is a screenshot.
